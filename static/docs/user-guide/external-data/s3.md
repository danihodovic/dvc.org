# External Data on S3 Compatible Storage

S3 Compatible Storage is a storage solution that allows access to and management
of the data it stores over an S3 compliant interface. Some providers of such a
storage are [Minio](https://min.io/),
[DigitalOcean Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces/),
[IBM Cloud Object Storage](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/object-storage) etc.

## S3 Remotes

To communicate with a remote object storage that supports an S3 compatible API
you must explicitly set the `endpointurl` in the configuration:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add s3remote s3://mybucket/path/to/dir

$ dvc remote modify s3remote \
      endpointurl https://object-storage.example.com

$ dvc remote list
s3storage	s3://mybucket/path/to/dir

$ cat .dvc/config
['remote "s3storage"']
url = s3://mybucket/path/to/dir
endpointurl = https://object-storage.example.com
```

S3 remotes can also be configured entirely via environment variables:

```dvc
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<my-access-key>"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<my-secret-key>"
$ dvc remote add s3remote "s3://bucket/myremote"
```

For more information about the variables DVC supports, please visit
[boto3 documentation](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/configuration.html#environment-variable-configuration)

## DVC Storage

To use an S3 storage as a DVC storage we should declare it as a default remote:

```dvc
$ dvc remote add --default s3storage s3://mybucket/path/to/dir
Setting 's3storage' as a default remote.

$ dvc remote modify s3storage \
      endpointurl https://object-storage.example.com

$ dvc remote list
s3storage	s3://mybucket/path/to/dir

$ cat .dvc/config
['remote "s3storage"']
url = s3://mybucket/path/to/dir
endpointurl = https://object-storage.example.com
[core]
remote = s3storage
```
